# C64-Bridge-Project
A repo for the C64 Bridge Project, a wireless USB Keyboard/HID emulator for the Raspberry Pi Zero W2, with a Serial Emulator bridge (can be used with the VibeC64 Project, see https://github.com/bbence84/VibeC64)<br><br>

**What is this Project?**<br>
This project is designed to allow for the remote transmission of keyboard strokes from a host computer, to the Raspberry Pi Zero W2, which then emulates a HID keyboard via gadget mode, and relays those keystrokes to the Commodore C64 Ultimate (see https://www.commodore.net/), while this project can have a myriad of uses, it is specifically designed to be a drop in, zero code additon to the VibeC64 Project (see https://github.com/bbence84/VibeC64) this then effectively gives Vieb64 the ability to remotely control the physical C64 Ultimate computer, coupled with a webcam, this allows VibeC64 to monitor, control and test basic applications and games on a physical C64 ultimate<br><br>

**Hardware**<br>
1 x Pi Zero 2 W<br>
1 x micro-USB data cable<br>
1 x OTG micro-USB shim<br>
1 x micro SD card (at least 4gb)<br><br>

Optional<br>
1 x micro-USB cable for power/setup<br>
